## Toast Notification Component

The **Toast Notification Component** is a customizable and responsive notification system built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It provides temporary feedback to users in the form of toast messages that automatically disappear after a few seconds. The toast messages can be customized for different types of notifications like success, error, and info.

- **Customizable**: You can create success, error, and informational toasts by passing different types and messages.
- **Responsive**: The toast notifications adjust their size and padding based on screen size.
- **Auto Dismiss**: Toasts automatically disappear after 3 seconds, but the duration can be customized.
- **Cool Animations**: Toasts slide down, scale up when they appear, and fade out while shrinking when they disappear.
