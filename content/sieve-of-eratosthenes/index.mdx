<DropCap>
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a specified integer. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2 as composite (not prime). After iterating through all numbers up to the square root of the limit, the remaining unmarked numbers are primes.

**Algorithm**:

- It starts by marking all numbers as prime.
- It iterates through the numbers starting from 2.
- For each prime number found, it marks its multiples as composite.
- Finally, it collects all unmarked numbers, which are prime.
